# Temperature Controller Task
You have the task of building a temperature controller system that will eventually replace my old line of controllers for [glass door coolers](http://tor-rey-refrigeration.com/glass-door-coolers/). You will build the temperature controller using two different web tools: Amalgam and Appliancizer. 

## Temperature Controller Software Requirements (Measure the time you spent building the software)
First you are required to simulate the temperature controller using plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. The software requirements are:

1.- A text that shows the temperature in Celsius (e.g., 25°C).   
1.- A slider that simulates the temperature input with a __range__ from -40°C to +125°C.    
2.- A __button__ that will trigger the _temperature set mode_ or move the temperature set point up (+1 °C)    
3.- A __button__ that will trigger the _temperature set mode_ or move the temperature set point down (-1 °C)   
4.- A __text__ that will show "ON" if the temperature is greater than the temperature set point, else OFF.    

_Temperature set mode_:   
Initial temperature set point: 25°C
- When the user preses a phyisical button once it should first show the current temperature set point, any consecutive preses should move the temperature set point up or down. 
- When in this mode the display text should blink ON and OFF every 1 second for 6 seconds. IF after 6 seconds the new set point is not equal to the current/original set point then set the current set point to the new set point, else do nothing. 

Use the app.html template found in (TODO) which you will use in the next step.
